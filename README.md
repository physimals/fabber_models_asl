The current version of the ASL models are designed to build with the latest 
version of Fabber from FSL. Although it may be possible to build them against older FSL
releases this is not guaranteed.

Build instructions for Fabber core and model libraries can be found here:

https://fabber-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html

## Successful build?

You can verify that the ASL models are available whichever method you choose:

    fabber_asl --listmodels
    
    asl_multiphase
    aslrest
    buxton
    linear
